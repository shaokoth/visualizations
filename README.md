# visualizations
This project focuses on exploring different data visualization libraries in Python to better understand and present datasets. The exercises simulate a real-world scenario where a data visualization specialist needs to create plots for both quick analysis and interactive dashboards.

## Overview
Data visualization is key to:

Understanding the distribution and relationships in datasets.

Communicating insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Choosing the right library depending on the use case:

Pandas Visualization Module → Quick and simple plots.

Matplotlib → Custom, detailed, and highly configurable plots.

Plotly → Interactive and dynamic visualizations for dashboards.

## Exercises

* Exercise 0: Environment and libraries setup (Python ≥ 3.9, pandas, numpy, jupyter, matplotlib, plotly).

* Exercise 1: Pandas Plot 1 → Bar plots with titles, axes labels, and legends.

* Exercise 2: Pandas Plot 2 → Scatter plots to explore relationships between variables.

* Exercise 3: Matplotlib 1 → Custom styled plots with limits, line styles, and markers.

* Exercise 4: Matplotlib 2 → Plotting data on twin axes to compare different ranges.

* Exercise 5: Matplotlib Subplots → Multiple plots in a grid layout with titles and text.

* Exercise 6: Plotly 1 → Interactive line plots (Plotly Express and Graph Objects).

* Exercise 7: Plotly Box Plots → Visualizing distributions and comparing multiple datasets.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/shaokoth/visualizations.git
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv ex00
source ex00/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy jupyter matplotlib plotly
```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
